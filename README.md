Fuck HoYoverse, coming straight out the underground
A young leaker got it bad 'cause I'm down,
Reversin' anime games like a fiend,
Attach a debugger to the game and I put the code on a CD,
Back all that stolen content up on DVD-ROMs,
'Cuz my tip's been leaking since I dropped out my Mom's,
And just because I post their OGGs,
They got the government comin' after me,
Instead of suin' kids, why don't you step on up,
And release a couple games that don't completely suck,
Stop puttin DRM onto video games,
Stop making bullshit copyright claims,
If I want your characters for free, I ain't gonna have to pay,
And all your bullshit is why I'm done,
I'm gonna keep reversin' games, son.

A young leaker got it bad 'cause I'm down,
Reversin' anime games like a fiend,
Attach a debugger to the game and I put the code on a CD,
And fuck the USA,
Fuck them for the DMCA

We play games for free,
Gacha banners you'll never fucking see,
Been a couple years since I seen a DMCA warning,
Cut it out, 'cause that's mad boring,
I'ma just keep fillin' up drives,
The ones that disapear when the lawsuit arrives,
I better see some changes or it's time to fight,
You ain't gonna manage my digital rights.

Remember when anti-trust was the thing,
Now you're sued for searchin' on Bing,
You treat us like criminals,
We're just innocent individuals,
Buyin' off senators left and right,
My vote doesnt count in this fight,
You want us to gamble our money, but I won't gamble my rights,
Fuck what you heard, it's all a scam,
If they at your door, burn 'em in a van.

They got dollar signs in their eyes,
With heads in-between politicians' thighs,
Fat checks endorsed by senators that lie,
Pullin' fake dollar losses straight outta the sky,
And I don't trust trusted computing,
They don't want it around to stop looting,
The internet is the only place you're still free,
If you disagree, just you wait and see,
You wanna lock down the web and throw away the key?
Well, you better not touch my technology,
So back off or you're dead,
Yellin' 1337 on a fed.
